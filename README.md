# UFO Sightings

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to transform plain UFO sightings data that has been collected and stored to be displayed in a website format. In doing so, users are able to view the data in a table and also filter the table on several criteria. 

## Results

The website offers a simple way to navigate through the UFO sighting data collected. 

On the left hand side of the page, there are five criteria from which the table can be filtered from. Users can leave all criteria as default to view the complete table with all the data. Users can additionally enter values in each box to filter the table and the acceptable format of search criteria entry is shown in each box by default. Furthermore, if one search criteria has been entered, users can then enter additional criteria to filter the filtered table further. 

For example, users wish to filter the table to only show sightings in Canada. Users would enter "ca" in the box next to "Entry Country" and the table will display data corresponding to Canada, like [so](https://github.com/donovancai/UFOs/blob/main/images/Country.jpg). If users would like to filter the table a step further to only show disk shaped UFO sightings, then users would enter "disk" in the search box next to "Enter Shape" and the table will be filtered like [so](https://github.com/donovancai/UFOs/blob/main/images/search_2.jpg).


No data will be shown in the table if the search criteria entered do not match the data in the table. To display the original table again, users can click on "UFO Sightings" on the upper left corner of the page to refresh the page, or simply clear all search criteria entered and hit enter on an empty search box. 

## Summary

One draw back of the new design is the removal of the filter button makes the website less intuitive to use. A recommendation to improve the website is to bring back the search button while keeping the new format, this way users can choose to use the enter key or press the search button to filter the table, making it a much more intuitive process. Another recommendation is to add more filters, such as the ability to sort by date in ascending/descending fashion, and also add a counter of the total search results so users can easily quantify the results.
